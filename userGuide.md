## Using Your Website

The ArXiv Search Tool provides powerful search capabilities to help you discover research papers. You can perform simple keyword searches or use advanced filters to narrow your results.

**Basic Search**: Enter keywords in the main search box and click "Search" to find papers. Results show the title, authors, publication date, abstract preview, and category tags. Click "Abstract" to read the full abstract or "PDF" to download the paper directly.

**Advanced Filters**: Click the filter icon next to the search box to access advanced options. Fill in "Title" to search paper titles specifically, "Author" to find papers by researcher name, "Abstract" to search within abstracts, or select a "Category" like Machine Learning or Computer Vision. You can also set "Start Date" and "End Date" to limit results to specific time periods. Click "Search" to apply filters or "Clear All" to reset them.
